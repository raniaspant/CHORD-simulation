# CHORD-simulation

Simulation of the lookup algorithm in a CHORD P2P network.

The active nodes are generated using the Linear Congruential Generator.

You can read the pdf for instructions on how to run and how it is executed.

I tried implementing a GUI using Tkinter instead of just printing everything in the console. ~~It didn't work that good.~~

There are default values for the Generator if you don't enter any. The path the lookup algorithm followed is also shown in a table after you enter the key value you want to look up.
